            Hello! I'm <strong><em>Obebe Ifeoluwa</em></strong>, and i'm a student at Babcock University.
            I am studying Software Enineering and I am currently in 300L.
            I have engaged my self in some of the projects we do in school
            which involves <strong><em>development</em></strong> and <strong><em>designing of software application and
            websites</em></strong>, etc. In my free time I am an outdoor enthusiast and I enjoy
            programming.

        <h3>Education</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Adventist Comprehensive High School</li>

        <p>
            I started High School in 2012 down to 2018 and I graduated. So I decided to go to Babcock University to study Software Engineering where I would be able to experience more of the practical aspect rather the theortical aspect. It has'nt been easy but with more practice I will improve and get better.
